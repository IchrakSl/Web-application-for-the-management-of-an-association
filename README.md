# Introduction
During the summer project for our first year of studies at ENSI, we undertook the development of a web application utilizing the following technologies:

- React JS
  
- Node JS
  
- Express JS
  
- MongoDB

The primary objective of this web application was to assist a local organization called "AGIM" in resource management and facilitate communication between their offices. Additionally, the application provided a platform for individuals to join the organization by completing a form within the application or gaining insights about the organization.
